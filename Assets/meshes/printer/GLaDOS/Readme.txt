If you want to use the ceiling verson of GLaDOS:

1. put GLaDOS.obj and GLaDOS.png into your prints folder and open the game if it isn't already.
2. print the normal GLaDOS.obj and put it into your inventory
3. take the GLaDOS_ceiling.obj put it onto your desktop and rename it to GLaDOS.obj
4. Drag the GLaDOS.obj that is on your desktop and replace the one in the print folder.
WARNING: Look DIRECTLY up while placing, the ceiling verson can be real jank so be careful and make sure there is enough room around you.

Extra: If you want both versons just follow the steps above and then make a copy of the ORIGIONAL GLaDOS.obj and the .png and rename them to GLaDOS_mini or something.
